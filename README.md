Hiüññüèº! My name is Daniel Osorio. I am a Colombian computational biologist. I'm currently working as a Senior Scientific Consultant at QIAGEN Digital Insight. I received my doctorate in Biomedical Sciences (Biomedical Genomics and Bioinformatics) from Texas A&M University. My research focuses on software development for studying high throughput single-cell RNA-seq data, gene regulatory networks, data mining, metabolic modeling, and bioactive peptides. I also have a master's degree in bioinformatics and a bachelor's degree in biology from Colombian universities.
