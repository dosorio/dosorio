My name is Daniel Osorio. I'm a Colombian Computational Biologist. Currently I'm working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Livestrong Cancer Institutes at UT Austin Dell Medical School. I have a doctorate in Biomedical Sciences (Biomedical Genomics and Bioinformatics) from Texas A&M University. My research focuses on software development for the study of high throughput single-cell RNA-seq data, gene regulatory networks, data mining, metabolic modeling and bioactive peptides. I also hold a masterâ€™s of science in bioinformatics and a bachelor's of science in biology from Colombian universities.
