Hiüññüèº! My name is Daniel Osorio. I am a Colombian computational biologist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Livestrong Cancer Institutes at UT Austin Dell Medical School. I have a doctorate in Biomedical Sciences (Biomedical Genomics and Bioinformatics) from Texas A&M University. My research focuses on software development for the study of high throughput single-cell RNA-seq data, gene regulatory networks, data mining, metabolic modeling and bioactive peptides. I also hold a MS. in bioinformatics and a BS. in biology from two Colombian universities.
